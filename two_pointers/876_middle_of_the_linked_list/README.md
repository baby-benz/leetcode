https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/

## Description

Given the head of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.


## Example 1:

![img.png](example_images/example_1.png)
    
    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
    Output: [3,4,5]
    Explanation: The middle node of the list is node 3.


## Example 2:

![img_1.png](example_images/example_2.png)

    Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    Output: [4,5,6]
    Explanation: Since the list has two middle nodes with values 3 and 4, we return the second one.


## Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 100].
- 1 <= Node.val <= 100
